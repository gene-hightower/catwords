# catwords

Find longest concatenated word in list of words.

This was a programming problem given to a friend of mine when he
applied for a job.

I played around with the problem a bit to see how I might use
range/v3.  It's sort of half assed in that respect.

Looking at the memory use and runtime of this program got me looking
at alternate sets and maps; that's how I found

I have also included his program.
